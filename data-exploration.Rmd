getwd()

df <- read.csv("data/Melbourne_housing_FULL.csv")
```

`Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

```{r}
library(dplyr)
grouped_by_suburb <- df %>% group_by(Suburb)

grouped_by_suburb %>% summarise(
  rooms = mean(Rooms)
)
```
